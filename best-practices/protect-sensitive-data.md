Before long, Acme Corp.'s sensitive data was compromised, resulting in a catastrophic data breach. The company faced massive fines, lawsuits, and a severely damaged reputation. Acme Corp. learned the hard way that when dealing with sensitive information, one must always take precautions with AI services. 👮‍♂️

## Easy Steps to Ensure Compliance Across Your Organization 🛡️

Here are some simple yet effective ways to protect sensitive data when using AI services in a tech-illiterate organization:
