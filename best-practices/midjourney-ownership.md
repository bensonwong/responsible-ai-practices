## Introduction

Incorporating AI services like ChatGPT into ongoing projects can offer significant benefits, such as enhanced efficiency and improved capabilities. However, integrating these services midjourney necessitates a comprehensive understanding of licensing and ownership implications. In this best practice, we'll discuss potential risks, provide examples of what can go wrong, and offer guidance on how to safeguard your organization during AI integration. 🚀

## Understanding Midjourney's Licensing and Ownership 📃

Here's a summary of Midjourney's licensing terms that can impact content ownership:

1. If you're using Midjourney's services on behalf of a company with over $1,000,000 USD in annual gross revenue, you must purchase a "Pro" membership for each individual using the services to own the assets you create.
2. If you're not a paid member, you don't own the assets you create. Instead, Midjourney grants you a license to the assets under the Creative Commons Noncommercial 4.0 Attribution International License.
3. Assets created using the Stealth feature in a "Pro" subscription have additional privacy protections.

Keep these points in mind when integrating Midjourney's AI service into your projects to ensure content ownership aligns with your organization's requirements.
