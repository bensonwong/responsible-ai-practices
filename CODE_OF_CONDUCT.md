# Code of Conduct for Responsible AI Practices

## Our Commitment

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment in the Responsible AI Practices project. We pledge to ensure that participation in our project and our community remains a harassment-free experience for everyone, irrespective of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We encourage the following behaviors to create a positive environment:

- Using inclusive and welcoming language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism with grace
- Prioritizing the best interests of the community
- Demonstrating empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behavior

Participants must refrain from engaging in the following behaviors:

- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Engaging in any other conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They can also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the Responsible AI Practices project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Enforcement

To report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, open an issue in the project repository or directly contact a project maintainer, identifiable in the project's MAINTAINERS file or on the project's GitHub page. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
